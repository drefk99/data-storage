## Motivation

##### Errors using inadequate data are much less than those using no data at all. ~ Charles Babbage


## Possible network troubleshooting

```
vim /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

# paste
network={
         ssid="wifi_name"
         psk="wifi_key"
}

ip link set wlan0 down
ip link set wlan0 up
wpa_supplicant -B -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dwext
sudo dhclient wlan0
```



## Let's get our tools

```
yum -y groups install "GNOME Desktop" 
yum -y install git vim curl
startx
```


## What is data?

Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things. [source](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/data.html)

![data types](images/data.png)

## What is science?

Science is the concerted human effort to understand, or to understand better, the history of the natural world and how the natural world works, with observable physical evidence as the basis of that understanding. [source](http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/1122science2.html#WHATISSCIENCE)

def you_need(something):
    for i in something:
        print(i)
        
    print('\n')
    return
    
        # if i is 'k':
        #   print('\n')
        #    break
        # if i == 'k':
        #   print('\n')
        #   break
        
my_break = 'break'
my_break1 = 'brkeak'

you_need(my_break)
you_need(my_break1)

```

## Seriouslly, what is Data Science?

* We’ll say that a data scientist is someone who extracts insights from messy data. Today’s world is full of people trying to turn data into insight. [1]
* Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured,[1][2] similar to Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). [2]

## Overview of the Data Platform
### Introducing Big Data

Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. But it’s not the amount of data that’s important. It’s what organizations do with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves. 

* **Volume**. Organizations collect data from a variety of sources, including business transactions, social media and information from sensor or machine-to-machine data. In the past, storing it would’ve been a problem – but new technologies (such as Hadoop) have eased the burden.

* **Velocity**. Data streams in at an unprecedented speed and must be dealt with in a timely manner. RFID tags, sensors and smart metering are driving the need to deal with torrents of data in near-real time.

* **Variety**. Data comes in all types of formats – from structured, numeric data in traditional databases to unstructured text documents, email, video, audio, stock ticker data and financial transactions.

At SAS, we consider two additional dimensions when it comes to big data:

* **Variability**. In addition to the increasing velocities and varieties of data, data flows can be highly inconsistent with periodic peaks. Is something trending in social media? Daily, seasonal and event-triggered peak data loads can be challenging to manage. Even more so with unstructured data.

* **Complexity**. Today's data comes from multiple sources, which makes it difficult to link, match, cleanse and transform data across systems. However, it’s necessary to connect and correlate relationships, hierarchies and multiple data linkages or your data can quickly spiral out of control. [1]

## How data comes to me?

* Continuous (is measured)
* Discrete (is counted)
* Ordinal 
* Categorical
* Missing
* Censored (real time)

## What about tidy data?

## Common infrastucture & DevOps features

![DevopsAgile](images/devopsagile_2.png)

## What is DevOps?

Basically infrastructure as code with agile practices plus steroids.

## Features

* Committing code frequently.
* Categorizing developer tests.
* Using a dedicated integration build machine.
* Using continuous feedback mechanisms.
* Staging builds.

## DevOps Stack

![Devops Benefits](images/dostack.png)

## Where are the steroids?

* Continuous Integration with Jenkins, Bamboo or Travis 
* Configuration with Chef, Pupet, Vagrant, Ansible
* Logging with Ganglia, Splunk, Flume, Nagios or New Relic
